# Julia-AI - Discord AI Bot
This bot, powered by a neural network, is capable of engaging in conversations with users and responding to messages. Additionally, it collects a database from all servers for open data, features multiple systems, and offers open-source code that can be modified under our license.

The bot integrates with ChatterBot for training and messaging. It also incorporates its own neural network for analyzing how emojis are used on servers. Users can generate graphs, contributing to the study of which emojis are most frequently used on servers, among other insights.

## Installation Locally or on Your Server
To install the bot on your server, you can either follow a link (currently unavailable, as this is in beta) or clone this repository locally. Afterward, create a new file with `$ touch .env` and input the following parameters: `TOKEN=your_token` for the bot to start working.

Next, run the `run.py` file or use the provided Dockerfile, both available in this repository.
